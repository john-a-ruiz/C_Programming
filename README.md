Programs and Exercises from chps 1 - 17 of the book 

I used different coding enviroments on different chapters of the book. For chps 2-7 I used the terminal on my Mac and the chapter files are titled 'chp..'. For chps 2, 7-13 I used Xcode and the chapter files are preceded by an 'x' to designate this, i.e. 'xch..'. For chps 14-17 I used Eclipse (Kepler) and the chapter files are preceded by and 'e' to designate this, i.e. 'ech..'.
